f"""Welcome the the **Bounty Goblins**!
⁣
After you register to this truly **remarkable** program, you will be assigned an experience level and given a bunch of bounties you can complete at your leisure.
⁣
**Normal bounties** can be completed once and award you the shown points.
**Competitive bounties** are meant to be a competition between all participants and reward a lot of points, but only one player can win. If there are any ties, both parties will of course get the points.
⁣
Your experience level determines which normal bounties you can complete. That way we can have easier bounties for new players compared to veterans.
